    "text": "Procedure\n\nDay 1\n\nFixation: Add sample to PFA with at least a 1:20 sample-to-PFA volume ratio.\n\nUse 4% just-made or just-thawed cold PFA, in PBS or other pH ~7 buffered solution.\nExcess PFA is okay; often use 1 mL by default.\n\nIncubation (Cold): Place on a cold shaker (4°C) for 30 minutes.\n\nPFA diffusion into the lung at 4°C takes ~30 minutes for 400 µm.\n\nCrosslinking: Bring the sample back to room temperature (RT) to allow PFA to cross-link for 15 minutes.\n\nPFA crosslinking is endothermic and requires heat.\nCaution: Over-crosslinking blocks target antigen sites!\n\nWash 1: Transfer from PFA to TBS, leave for 15 minutes at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\nWash 2 (Permeabilization): Wash 3 times with 0.5% TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n\nUse 0.1% TBST for weaker stains like αSMA.\nTBST washes help clear the sample.\n\nBlocking: Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n\nUse 10% Donkey Serum in TBST.\n\nPrimary Antibody Incubation (Setup): Combine primary antibodies with fresh blocking solution (500 µL). Pipette gently to mix.\n\nNote any volume alterations.\nDo not vortex! Vortexing introduces air bubbles.\nStandard primaries used:\n\nECad Mouse 1:500\nTom20 Rabbit 1:100\n\n\nPrimary Antibody Incubation (Execution): Add samples to the primary antibody cocktail and incubate for 48 hours at 4°C on a shaker.\n\nPrimary antibodies can be refrozen.\nLarge samples may need 3 days of incubation.\n\n\n\n\nDay 3\n\nWash 3: Wash 4 times with TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\nBlocking: Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\nSecondary Antibody Incubation (Setup): Combine secondary antibodies with fresh blocking solution (500 µL). Pipette gently to mix. Protect from light (wrap in foil).\n\nNote any volume alterations.\nDo not vortex!\nAdd non-antibody dyes (e.g., DAPI, Phalloidin) at this step.\nCentrifuge secondary antibodies (20 minutes at max speed) before adding to remove aggregates.\nStandard secondaries/dyes used:\n\n1:2000 DAPI (Concentrations &gt;1:1000 can cause precipitation)\n1:200 Phalloidin 488 (Caution: Methanol contamination after this step destroys Phalloidin signal!)\n1:500 Alexa 555 (Donkey Anti-Rabbit)\n1:500 Alexa 680 (Donkey Anti-Mouse)\n\n\nSecondary Antibody Incubation (Execution): Incubate samples in the secondary antibody cocktail for 24 hours at 4°C on a shaker.\n\nSecondaries can be frozen once but not freeze-thawed repeatedly.\nLarge samples may need 2-3 days of incubation.\n\n\n\nNote on 2-Photon (2P) Microscopy Compatibility:\nA compatible set of secondaries/dyes for 2P imaging: DAPI, 488 Phalloidin, 568 Donkey anti-Rabbit (or 594), 680 Donkey anti-Mouse.\n\n\n\nDay 4 (or Day 3 Evening) - Washing & Clearing\n\nWash 4: Perform 3 washes with TBST for 15 minutes each at RT.\n\nTo exchange media, use a narrow pipette tip (≤200 µL) kept above the sample, or use a cut tip carefully.\n\nWash 5: Transfer to PBS for 15 minutes to wash off TBST.\nDehydration/Clearing (Isopropanol): Titrate through Isopropanol series: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (15 minutes each step).\n\nThis titration significantly contributes to clearing; do not shorten the times.\nUse this time to prepare the imaging chamber.\n\nImaging Chamber Preparation:\n\nAttach a nylon washer to a coverslip using vacuum grease.\nPress firmly on the washer with tweezers (not a flexible tool) to squeeze out excess grease.\nSeal the perimeter of the washer with nail polish. Wait 15 minutes. Apply a second coat of nail polish.\nAfter curing, use tweezers to remove any stray grease or polish from the inner diameter of the washer.\nPre-use Check: Add 1:1 Isopropanol:BABB (iso:BABB) to the washer to check for leaks and flush contaminants. Repeat if the liquid turns opaque.\n\nClearing (iso:BABB): Place samples in the final container, add 1:1 iso:BABB. Position the samples if possible. Wait 5 minutes.\n\nCaution: Handle BABB carefully (contains Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Benzoate).\n\nClearing (BABB): Remove iso:BABB with a thin-tip pipette. Add 100% BABB. Position samples if visible.\nMounting: Seal the container (e.g., coverslip onto the washer), minimizing air bubbles. Tapping the coverslip helps create a good seal. A small amount of extra BABB can be added during sealing to prevent a large bubble.\nImaging: Image as soon as possible after clearing (ideally the same day). DAPI signal fades over time, and bubbles can form in the sample holder.",
