    "text": "The most common thing I hear is the way you find the excitation wavelength to image 2P is you take the normal excitation, and double it. I’m not going to show a diagram of that concept here, because I don’t want to perpetuate it. Instead let me show you some spectra.\nHere is the spectra for eGFP; normal excitation is \\(488 \\text{ nm}\\), but double that to \\(976 \\text{ nm}\\) and you get about half the efficiency of the real peak at \\(926 \\text{ nm}\\).\n\nIf it were simply doubling the wavelength, those spectra would look very different.\nAnd then consider the Alexa fluorophores: Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 594, Alexa 647. You’d expect 2P wavelengths of \\(976 \\text{ nm}\\), \\(1136 \\text{ nm}\\), \\(1188 \\text{ nm}\\), and \\(1294 \\text{ nm}\\), respectively. Instead, you’ll find peak excitations around \\(900 \\text{ nm}\\), \\(810 \\text{ nm}\\), \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\), and \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\) respectively, with secondary peaks of excitation, for instance with Alexa 647 at \\(1200 \\text{ nm}\\). In fact, you can excite almost every single Alexa fluorophore at \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\) through 2P. Someone should really write a paper about that and make a modern database of 2P excitation spectra while you are at it!\nSo, ** 2P excitation is not double normal excitation **.",

    "text": "The Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle\nFrom experiment, we have discovered a rule of physics that there exists a timescale in which the universe does not resolve energy transitions. \\[ \\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\] Where \\(\\hbar=h/2\\pi\\). \\(\\Delta t\\) is the timescale, and \\(\\Delta E\\) is the relevant energy. In the case of two-photon, the relevant energy is similar to the mismatch between the photon energy and the energy needed to excite the molecule.\n\n\nIf you have an \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\) photon, it has an energy of approximately \\(2.5 \\times 10^-19 J\\). If you need an energy of approximately \\(5 \\times 10^-19 J\\), then: \\[ \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta E}\\] \\[ \\approx \\frac{10^-34 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}}{2\\times2.5\\times10^-19 \\text{ J}} \\] \\[ \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}, \\] roughly a femtosecond.\nIf we can introduce two photons to the molecule in a timescale smaller than \\(\\Delta t\\), roughly a femtosecond, we can start to consider second-order interactions between the molecule and multiple “simultaneous” photons. Note the bigger the energy gap \\(\\Delta E\\) between the photon and the actual excitation that you need, the smaller the timescale \\(\\Delta t\\).\nTo do this experimentally, we build really high-power lasers. We pulse these high-power lasers to send out all the photons in as short a chirp as we can, to increase the probability that we get one of these interactions. Also, note that you don’t need to use two photons of the same energy. If you have the luxury of having multiple two-photon lasers, it is possible to get some very good excitations from two different wavelengths coming in at the same pulse.\n\n\nSymmetry Selection Rules It is worth noting that a single photon exciting a molecule transitions the symmetry of the state, while two photons exciting a molecule do not change the symmetry of the state. So the one-photon excited state, \\(S_1\\), is a different (lower) state than the two-photon excited state (S_+).",

    "section": "2-Photon accesses a different excited state",
    "text": "2-Photon accesses a different excited state\nThe two-photon process for Alexa 647 is accessing an excited state, \\(S_1^+\\), that is slightly higher in energy than the \\(S_1\\) state. The shorter wavelength, \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\), means each photon carries more energy. The two-photon process does not access the same electronic state as the one-photon process. I think that the fact that many Alexa fluorophores can be efficiently excited around \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\) is because these dyes, despite their varying \\(S_0 \\rightarrow S_1\\) energy gaps, have a common higher-lying electronic state that is strongly 2P-allowed and accessible with the combined energy of two \\(\\approx 800 \\text{ nm}\\) photons. This isn’t entirely surprising, as the Alexa dyes are based on related rhodamine or cyanine core structures, which could possess similar higher-energy manifolds of electronic states. The presence of multiple 2P excitation peaks for Alexa 647 (around \\(800 \\text{ nm}\\) and \\(1200 \\text{ nm}\\)) indicates that there are at least two different electronic states (or distinct vibronic progressions to different states) that can be efficiently accessed via 2PA. The \\(\\approx 1200 \\text{ nm}\\) peak is closer to the “doubled” 1P wavelength, suggesting it might access a 2P-allowed state energetically nearer to the \\(S_1\\) state, while the \\(\\approx 800 \\text{ nm}\\) peak accesses a much higher energy state.\nAfter two-photon excitation, the higher state \\(S_+\\) falls back to a state like \\(S_1\\) (typically via internal conversion and vibrational relaxation to the lowest vibrational level of the lowest excited singlet state), which then falls back to the ground state \\(S_0\\). That final transition gives you the normal emission that you expect from a fluorophore. There is often a small but systematic red-shift of that final emission. Understanding where that red-shift comes from is left as an exercise to the reader.",

A molecule in the \\(S_N\\) electronic state can be in vibrational levels (\\(v=0, v=1, ...\\)).\nWhen a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions from \\(S_0, v=0\\) to one of the many vibrational levels in \\(S_1\\). The energy of the absorbed photon matches the energy difference between the initial vibronic state (electronic + vibrational) and the final vibronic state.

Minimum volume: 500 µL.\nWash 2 (Permeabilization): Wash 3 times with 0.5% TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n\nUse 0.1% TBST for weaker stains like αSMA.\nTBST washes help clear the sample.\n\nBlocking: Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n\nUse 10% Donkey Serum in TBST.\n\nPrimary Antibody Incubation (Setup): Combine primary antibodies with fresh blocking solution (500 µL). Pipette gently to mix.\n\nNote any volume alterations.\nDo not vortex! Vortexing introduces air bubbles.\nStandard primaries used:\n\nECad Mouse 1:500\nTom20 Rabbit 1:100\n\n\nPrimary Antibody Incubation (Execution): Add samples to the primary antibody cocktail and incubate for 48 hours at 4°C on a shaker.\n\nPrimary antibodies can be refrozen.\nLarge samples may need 3 days of incubation.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde (\\(CH_2O\\)) Chemistry\n\\(CH_2O\\) reacts with primary amine groups, R-\\(NH_2\\), in proteins. This forms a \\(R-N=CH_2\\) which can react with another amine group to form a stable methylene bridge \\(R-NH-CH_2-NH-R'\\).

Wait 15 minutes. Apply a second coat of nail polish.\nAfter curing, use tweezers to remove any stray grease or polish from the inner diameter of the washer.\nPre-use Check: Add 1:1 Isopropanol:BABB (iso:BABB) to the washer to check for leaks and flush contaminants. Repeat if the liquid turns opaque.\n\nClearing (iso:BABB): Place samples in the final container, add 1:1 iso:BABB. Position the samples if possible. Wait 5 minutes.\n\nCaution: Handle BABB carefully (contains Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Benzoate).\n\nClearing (BABB): Remove iso:BABB with a thin-tip pipette. Add 100% BABB. Position samples if visible.\nMounting: Seal the container (e.g., coverslip onto the washer), minimizing air bubbles. Tapping the coverslip helps create a good seal. A small amount of extra BABB can be added during sealing to prevent a large bubble.\nImaging: Image as soon as possible after clearing (ideally the same day). DAPI signal fades over time, and bubbles can form in the sample holder.",
