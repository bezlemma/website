Download Julia here: [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

Open the Julia application. You should see a startup banner similar to this:

```
*Try typing in 2+2 and hitting enter. If you know LaTeX, Julia is happy to think about LaTeX commands, so try typing in \pi whcih turns into Ï€ and hitting enter*

## Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

*After* confirming Julia runs, download and install VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

*   Open VS Code.
*   Click on the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. It looks like four squares forming a larger square, with the top-right square slightly detached.
*   Search for "Julia" in the search bar.
*   Find the extension named **Julia** published by `julialang` and click **Install**.

## Create and Run Your First Julia File

*   Create a new file named `HelloJulia.jl`.
*   Open this file in VS Code.
*   Paste the following code into the file:

```julia
println("The first digits of pi are: ", pi)
```

*   Run the code by clicking the **Run** button (a trinagluar play icon) in the top-right corner of the editor.


# Manage Julia Packages

In the VS Code terminal panel where you saw the output, you should see the Julia prompt `julia>`. Press the `]` key (right square bracket). The prompt will change to indicate you are in package mode. To exit `Pkg` mode and return to the standard `julia>` prompt, press the `Backspace` key.

While in `Pkg` mode, type the following command and press Enter:

```julia
add GLMakie CairoMakie DataFrames
```

Then wait for installation, this can take awhile.


## Graph some data

Now you can modify your `HelloJulia.jl` script (or create a new one) to use these packages. Here's an example that creates a simple plot using Makie and saves it as a PDF:

```{julia}
using GLMakie, DataFrames # CairoMakie

# Create some sample data
x = 0:0.1:2pi
y_sin = sin.(x)
y_cos = cos.(x)

# Create a DataFrame (optional, but useful to show now rather that later)
df = DataFrame(X=x, SinY=y_sin, CosY=y_cos)

# Create the plot figure and axis
fig = Figure(size = (400, 400))
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel = "X [um]", ylabel = "Y [Pa]")

# Plot the lines
lines!(ax, df.X, df.SinY, label = "sin(x)", color = :blue, linewidth = 2)
lines!(ax, df.X, df.CosY, label = "cos(x)", color = :red, linewidth = 2)

axislegend(ax) # Add a legend

# Show the plot in an interactive window
#GLMakie.activate!() 
fig #or display(fig)


# Save the plot as a PDF
#CairoMakie.activate!()
#save("plot.pdf", fig)
```
