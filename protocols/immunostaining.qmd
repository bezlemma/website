> **Note:** This protocol is a modification of a protocol given to me by Katie Goodwin, inspired by Crystal Rogers's suggestion to add CaCl2 and use TBS to accommodate ECad staining in the chicken. It is optimized for simultaneously accommodating staining of Mitochondria (Tom20) / Ecadherin and Actin (through Phalloidin) at the same time. You can achieve better results if you drop one or two of those stains. For instance, Methanol is much better in Murray's clear than Ethanol if you can drop Phalloidin. ECad staining looks much better without Glutaraldehyde if you can drop mito. And Mito staining looks a little bit better using PBS instead of TBS if you can drop ECad.

## Materials Needed

### Room Temperature
- **TBS:** TBS with 7.35 mg/L $CaCl_2$
- **TBST:** TBS and 0.5% Triton

### On Ice or 4°C
- **PFA:** 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde diluted into PBS
- **Donkey Block:** 10% Donkey Serum with TBST
- **Primaries** Primary Antibodies for Day 1
- **Secondaries and Stains** Secondary Antibodies and Stains for Day 3

## Procedure

### Day 1

1.  **Fixation:** Add sample to cold PFA with at least a 1:20 sample-to-PFA volume ratio.
    *   Use 4% just-made or just-thawed cold PFA, in PBS or other pH ~7 buffered solution.
    *   Use 1 mL PFA by default.

    **Formaldehyde ($CH_2O$) Chemistry**

    $CH_2O$ reacts with primary amine groups, R-$NH_2$, in proteins. This forms a $R-N=CH_2$ which can react with another amine group to form a stable methylene bridge $R-NH-CH_2-NH-R'$. These bridges cross-link proteins, solidifying the biological structure.

2.  **Incubation (Cold):** Place on a cold shaker (4°C) for 30 minutes.
    *   PFA diffusion into the lung at 4°C takes ~30 minutes for 400 µm.
3.  **Crosslinking:** Bring the sample back to room temperature (RT) to allow PFA to cross-link for 15 minutes.
    *   PFA crosslinking is endothermic and requires heat, hence the room temperature.
    *   Over-crosslinking blocks target antigen sites!
4.  **Wash and Permeabilization** Transfer from PFA to 500 µL TBS, leave for 15 minutes at RT on a shaker. 
5.  *   Wash 3 times with 500 µL TBS 0.5% TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker.
    *   Use 0.1% TBST for some weaker-bound antibodies like αSMA.
    *   TBST washes help clear the sample.
6.  **Blocking:** Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker.
    *   Use 500 µL 10% Donkey Serum in TBST.
7.  **Primary Antibody Incubation:** Combine primary antibodies with blocking solution. Pipette gently to mix.
    *   Note any volume alterations.
    *   **Do not vortex!** Vortexing oxyginates the liquid.
    *   Add samples to the primary antibody cocktail and incubate for 48 hours at 4°C on a shaker.
    *   Primary antibodies can be refrozen.
    *   Large samples may need 3 days of incubation, while small samples might be fine with just 1.

### Day 3

1.  **Wash:** Wash 4 times with 500 µL TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker.
2. **Blocking:** Block with 500 µL for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. 
3. **Secondary Antibody Incubation:** Combine secondary antibodies with 500 µL blocking solution. Pipette gently to mix. 
    *   Note any volume alterations.
    *   **Do not vortex!**
    *   Add non-antibody dyes such as DAPI and Phalloidin at this step.
    *   If using a sensative dye such as DAPI, protect from light.
    *   Centrifuge secondary antibodies (20 minutes at max speed) before adding to remove aggregates.
    *   Incubate samples in the secondary antibody cocktail for 24 hours at 4°C on a shaker.
    *   Secondaries can be frozen once but not freeze-thawed repeatedly.
    *   Large samples may need 2-3 days of incubation.

### Day 4 - Washing & Clearing

1. **Wash** Perform 3 washes with TBST for 15 minutes each at RT.
    * Transfer to PBS for 15 minutes to wash off TBST.
2. **Dehydration/Clearing (Isopropanol or Methanol):** Titrate through Isopropanol series: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (15 minutes each step).
    *   This titration significantly contributes to clearing; do not shorten the times.
    *   Use this time to prepare the imaging chamber.
    *   Methanol clearing is much more effective, but doesn't work for Phalloidin.
3. **Imaging Chamber Preparation:**
    *   Attach a nylon washer to a coverslip using vacuum grease.
    *   Press firmly on the washer with a rod to squeeze out excess grease.
    *   Seal the perimeter of the washer with nail polish. Wait 15 minutes. Apply a second coat of nail polish.
    *   After curing, use tweezers to remove any stray grease or polish from the inner diameter of the washer.
    *   **Pre-use Check:** Add 1:1 Isopropanol:BABB (iso:BABB) to the washer to check for leaks and flush contaminants. Repeat if the liquid turns opaque or looks contaminated.
        *   **Caution:** Handle BABB with gloves, and take care not to get it all over surfaces in the lab.
4. **Clearing (iso:BABB):** Place samples in the final container, add 1:1 iso:BABB. Position the samples if possible. Wait 5 minutes.
5. **Clearing (BABB):** Remove iso:BABB with a thin-tip pipette. Add 100% BABB. Position samples if visible.
6. **Mounting:** Seal the coverslip onto the washer, this is the trickiest bit.
    * One strategy is to drop the entire coverslip perfectly onto the washer from above.
    * Another strategy is to slide it in on the side, while similtaniously adding more BABB with a pipette wherever air bubbles are forming.
7. **Imaging:** Image as soon as possible after clearing. DAPI signal fades over time, and bubbles can form in the sample holder.

## Open Questions

*   Can the Triton concentration be lowered? Does it improve the image?
*   Can TBS be replaced with PBS? What are the effects?
*   How sensitive is this protocol to CaCl2 concentration, and at which steps is it critical?
*   Does TCA fixation work better? (Suggested by Raj Ladher for pMLC staining; **Note:** Not compatible with Actin staining).
*   Does a gradual increase in PFA concentration  work better? (Suggested by Raj Ladher).
