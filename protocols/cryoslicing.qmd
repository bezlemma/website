## Preparing for Frozen Embedding

1.  Fix in 4% PFA at 4 degrees (time depends on sample, at least 30 min).
2.  Rinse in PBS or wash in PBS overnight, depending on sample.
3.  Wash 1 hr on shaker at room temperature in 20% sucrose (=2 g of sucrose in a 15 ml tube filled up to 10 ml with preferably sterile 1X PBS, store at 4C).
4.  Wash 1 hr on shaker at room temperature in 30% sucrose (=3 g of sucrose in a 15 ml tube filled up to 10 ml with preferably sterile 1X PBS, store at 4C).
5.  Wash 1 hr on shaker at room temperature in 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose (store at 4C).
6.  Wash overnight on shaker at 4 degrees in 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose.

## Embedding and Freezing

### Materials Needed
- Dry Ice or similar freezing agent.
- Cube plastic inserts.
- OCT (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound).
- Forceps.
- Sharpie.

### Procedure

1.  Add a drop of OCT from the squeeze bottle to each insert, enough to cover the bottom of the insert well, and label each insert using a sharpie.
2.  Using forceps, transfer lungs over to the inserts. Depending on tissue size, you might be able to move the sample in a little bubble of OCT suspended between the tips of the forceps.
3.  Pipette away solution from around the lung to remove sucrose.
4.  Remove one piece of dry ice, maybe 1-2 inches long, and place on bench to sublimate until it has a flat surface.
5.  Flip the dry ice piece over and place a plastic cube insert onto the flat surface. After a few moments the OCT will turn white as it freezes.
6.  After freezing, add more OCT on top to fill the insert.
7.  Keep holding the insert on the dry ice until the OCT block has frozen through.
8.  Store at -80Â°C until ready to cryo-slice.
