## Tissue Fixation and Cryoprotection

**Procedure:**

1.  **Fixation:**
    * Immerse tissue in 4% PFA at 4°C. Fixation time is sample-dependent (see immunostaining protocol)*
2.  **Rinsing:**
    * Remove PFA and rinse with 1X PBS. 
3.  **Cryoprotection:**
    * Transfer samples to 20% sucrose/PBS solution.
    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for at least 1 hour. *Tissue sinking indicates adequate sucrose infiltration.*
    * Transfer samples to 30% sucrose/PBS solution.
    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for at least 1 hour. For denser or larger tissues, this step can be overnight.
4.  **OCT Infiltration:**
    * Transfer samples to the 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution.
    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hr.
    * Transfer samples to fresh 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution.
    * Incubate on a shaker at 4°C overnight. This ensures complete infiltration with the embedding medium.

## Tissue Embedding and Freezing

This process involves orienting the cryoprotected tissue in OCT within a mold and rapidly freezing it.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Prepare Molds and Workspace:**
    * Label molds clearly with the permanent marker.
    * Place a small amount of OCT in a layer at the bottom of each mold.
2.  **Transfer and Orient Tissue:**
    * Transfer the tissue into the OCT-lined mold.
    * Gently orient the tissue to the desired cutting plane. This is a critical step for getting nice sections.
          * If the tissue is small, you can transfer it with a small bubble of the OCT/sucrose solution.
    * Carefully pipette or wick away any excess 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution from around the tissue within the mold.
3.  **Add OCT and Initial Freeze:**
    * Remove one piece of dry ice, maybe 1-2 inches long, and place on bench to sublimate until it has a flat surface.
    * Flip the dry ice piece over and place a plastic cube insert onto the flat surface. After a few moments the OCT will turn white as it freezes.
4.  **Complete Embedding and Freezing:**
    * Once the base layer with the tissue is partially frozen and stable, add OCT to cover the tissue and fill the mold. Avoid air bubbles.
    * Hold the mold on the dry ice until the entire OCT block is opaque white and frozen solid. This may take several minutes depending on the block size.
    * Store in -80.

```

**Cryostat Preparation:**

* Ensure the cryostat chamber is at -21°C. *If the cryostat is warm, it may be someone is intentionally deforsting it*

**Slicing Procedure:**

1.  **Prepare Workspace and Mount Block:**
    * Place paper towels or absorbent paper in the cryostat chamber below the blade holder to catch trimmings.
    * Securely install a razor blade into the blade holder.
    * Use the OCT like glue at this temperature. Apply a thin layer of fresh OCT to the surface of a pre-cooled specimen chuck.
    * Quickly press your frozen OCT block onto the OCT on the chuck. Allow it to freeze firmly in place for a few minutes.
2.  **Mount Chuck and Align Block:**
    * Mount the chuck with the sample block into the cryostat's specimen holder.
    * Coarsely trim the block using the cryostat's advance mechanism until the blade is near the ice.
    * Adjust the orientation of the block relative to the blade to ensure the cutting face is parallel to the blade edge.
    * Try a test slice, the blade will hit one corner first, re-adjust the orientation and repeat until hitting all four corners of the sample block.
    * Coarse cut until you reach your sample
    * Set the desired section thickness (typically ~10 µm).
4.  **Sectioning and Collection:**
    * **Collecting Sections:**
        * **With Plate:** If using a plate, adjust it to be parallel and very close to the blade edge. As the section is cut, it should slide between the blade and the plate.
        * **With a Paintbrush:**
            * As the section begins to come off the blade, use a thin paintbrush held at a low angle to gently guide the leading edge of the section and prevent it from curling.
    * **Transferring to Slide:**
        * Carefully bring a room-temperature glass slide towards the section.
        * Align the section with the slide and gently touch the slide to the section. The section will adhere to the slide.
5.  **Drying and Storage of Slides:**
    * Allow sections to air-dry briefly at room temperature
