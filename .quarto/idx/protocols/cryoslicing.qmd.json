Fixation time is sample-dependent (see immunostaining protocol)*\n2.  **Rinsing:**\n    * Remove PFA and rinse with 1X PBS. \n3.  **Cryoprotection - Step 1 (20% Sucrose):**\n    * Transfer samples to 20% sucrose/PBS solution.\n    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or until the tissue sinks. *Tissue sinking indicates adequate sucrose infiltration.*\n4.  **Cryoprotection - Step 2 (30% Sucrose):**\n    * Transfer samples to 30% sucrose/PBS solution.\n    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or until the tissue sinks. For denser or larger tissues, this step can be extended (e.g., overnight at 4°C).\n5.  **Pre-embedding Infiltration (1:1 OCT:30% Sucrose - Short Incubation):**\n    * Transfer samples to the 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution.\n    * Incubate on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour. This helps acclimate the tissue to the OCT.\n6.  **Final Infiltration (1:1 OCT:30% Sucrose - Long Incubation):**\n    * Transfer samples to fresh 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution.\n    * Incubate on a shaker at 4°C overnight. This ensures complete infiltration with the embedding medium.\n\n---\n\n## Tissue Embedding and Freezing\n\nThis process involves orienting the cryoprotected tissue in OCT within a mold and rapidly freezing it.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Prepare Molds and Workspace:**\n    * Label molds clearly with the permanent marker.\n    * Place a small amount of OCT in the bottom of each mold to create a base layer.\n2.  **Transfer and Orient Tissue:**\n    * Using forceps, carefully transfer the infiltrated tissue from the 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution into the OCT-lined mold.\n    * Gently orient the tissue to the desired cutting plane. This is a critical step for getting nice sections.\n          * If the tissue is small, you can transfer it with a small \"bubble\" of the OCT/sucrose solution using the forceps to minimize direct handling.\n3.  **Remove Excess Sucrose Solution:**\n    * Carefully pipette or wick away any excess 1:1 OCT:30% sucrose solution from around the tissue within the mold.\n4.  **Add OCT and Initial Freeze:**\n    * Remove one piece of dry ice, maybe 1-2 inches long, and place on bench to sublimate until it has a flat surface.\n    * Flip the dry ice piece over and place a plastic cube insert onto the flat surface. After a few moments the OCT will turn white as it freezes.\n    * Place the mold onto the flat surface of the dry ice. The OCT at the bottom will begin to turn white as it freezes.\n5.  **Complete Embedding and Freezing:**\n    * Once the base layer with the tissue is partially frozen and stable, gently add more OCT to completely cover the tissue and fill the mold. Avoid trapping air bubbles.\n    * Continue to hold the mold on the dry ice until the entire OCT block is opaque white and frozen solid. This may take several minutes depending on the block size.\n    * Store in -80.\n\n---\n\n## Slicing\n\n```{=html}\n<video autoplay loop muted playsinline width=\"600\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n  <source src=\"../assets/CryoSlice.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n```\n\n**Cryostat Preparation:**\n\n* Ensure the cryostat chamber is at -21°C. *If the cryostat is warm, it may be someone is intentionally deforsting it*\n\n**Slicing Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Prepare Workspace and Mount Block:**\n    * Place paper towels or absorbent paper in the cryostat chamber below the blade holder to catch trimmings.\n    * Securely install a new, sharp razor blade into the blade holder.\n    * Use the OCT like glue at this temperature. Apply a thin layer of fresh OCT to the surface of a pre-cooled specimen chuck.\n    * Quickly press your frozen OCT block onto the OCT on the chuck. Allow it to freeze firmly in place for a few minutes.\n2.  **Mount Chuck and Align Block:**\n    * Mount the chuck with the sample block into the cryostat's specimen holder.\n    * Coarsely trim the block using the cryostat's advance mechanism until the blade is near the ice.\n    * Adjust the orientation of the block relative to the blade to ensure the cutting face is parallel to the blade edge.\n    * Try a test slice, the blade will hit one corner first, re-adjust the orientation and repeat until hitting all four corners of the sample block.\n    * Coarse cut until you reach your sample\n    * Set the desired section thickness (typically ~10 µm).\n4.  **Sectioning and Collection:**\n    * **Collecting Sections:**\n        * **With Plate:** If using a plate, adjust it to be parallel and very close to the blade edge. As the section is cut, it should slide between the blade and the plate, remaining flat.\n        * **With a Paintbrush:**\n            * As the section begins to come off the blade, use a tihn paintbrush held at a low angle to gently guide the leading edge of the section and prevent it from curling.\n            * With a smooth, continuous cutting motion, guide the section flat onto the blade or allow it to hang slightly.\n    * **Transferring to Slide:**\n        * Carefully bring a room-temperature glass slide towards the flat section.\n        * Align the section with the slide and gently touch the slide to the section. The temperature difference will cause the section to adhere to the slide.\n5.  **Drying and Storage of Slides:**\n    * Allow sections to air-dry briefly at room temperature \n    * Slides can be stored in a slide box at -20°C or -80°C (ensure they are completely dry before freezing to prevent ice crystal artifacts).\n\n\n---\n\n## Staining\n\n1.
