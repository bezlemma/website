It is optimized for simultaneously accommodating staining of Mitochondria (Tom20) / Ecadherin and Actin (through Phalloidin) at the same time. You can achieve better results if you drop one or two of those stains. For instance, Methanol is much better in Murray's clear than Ethanol if you can drop Phalloidin. ECad staining looks much better without Glutaraldehyde if you can drop mito. And Mito staining looks a little bit better using PBS instead of TBS if you can drop ECad.\n\n> **Reference:** Plasticity in airway smooth muscle differentiation during mouse lung development, Goodwin, Katharine et al. Developmental Cell, Volume 58, Issue 5, 338 - 347.e4\n\n\n### Room Temperature\n- **TBS:** TBS with 7.35 mg/L CaCl2 (can make 10x initially for easier measurement)\n- **TBST:** TBS and 0.5% Triton (if calcium added to TBS, no need to add extra calcium here)\n\n### On Ice (or 4°C)\n- **PFA:** 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde diluted into PBS\n- **Donkey Block:** 10% Donkey Serum with TBST\n- **Primaries** Primary Antibodies for Day 1\n- **Secondaries and Stains** Secondary Antibodies and Stains for Day 3\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Day 1\n\n1.  **Fixation:** Add sample to cold PFA with at least a 1:20 sample-to-PFA volume ratio.\n    *   Use 4% just-made or just-thawed cold PFA, in PBS or other pH ~7 buffered solution.\n    *   Use 1 mL PFA by default.\n\n    ::: {.column-margin}\n    **Formaldehyde ($CH_2O$) Chemistry**\n\n    $CH_2O$ reacts with primary amine groups, R-$NH_2$, in proteins. This forms a $R-N=CH_2$ which can react with another amine group to form a stable methylene bridge $R-NH-CH_2-NH-R'$. These bridges cross-link proteins, solidifying the biological structure.\n    :::\n\n2.  **Incubation (Cold):** Place on a cold shaker (4°C) for 30 minutes.\n    *   PFA diffusion into the lung at 4°C takes ~30 minutes for 400 µm.\n3.  **Crosslinking:** Bring the sample back to room temperature (RT) to allow PFA to cross-link for 15 minutes.\n    *   PFA crosslinking is endothermic and requires heat.\n    *   **Caution:** Over-crosslinking blocks target antigen sites!\n4.  **Wash 1:** Transfer from PFA to TBS, leave for 15 minutes at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n5.  **Wash 2 (Permeabilization):** Wash 3 times with 0.5% TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n    *   Use 0.1% TBST for weaker stains like αSMA.\n    *   TBST washes help clear the sample.\n6.  **Blocking:** Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n    *   Use 10% Donkey Serum in TBST.\n7.  **Primary Antibody Incubation (Setup):** Combine primary antibodies with fresh blocking solution (500 µL). Pipette gently to mix.\n    *   Note any volume alterations.\n    *   **Do not vortex!** Vortexing introduces air bubbles.\n    *   Standard primaries used:\n        *   ECad Mouse 1:500\n        *   Tom20 Rabbit 1:100\n8.  **Primary Antibody Incubation (Execution):** Add samples to the primary antibody cocktail and incubate for 48 hours at 4°C on a shaker.\n    *   Primary antibodies can be refrozen.\n    *   Large samples may need 3 days of incubation.\n\n### Day 3\n\n9.  **Wash 3:** Wash 4 times with TBST for 15 minutes each at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n10. **Blocking:** Block for 1 hour at RT on a shaker. Minimum volume: 500 µL.\n11. **Secondary Antibody Incubation (Setup):** Combine secondary antibodies with fresh blocking solution (500 µL). Pipette gently to mix. Protect from light (wrap in foil).\n    *   Note any volume alterations.\n    *   **Do not vortex!**\n    *   Add non-antibody dyes (e.g., DAPI, Phalloidin) at this step.\n    *   Centrifuge secondary antibodies (20 minutes at max speed) before adding to remove aggregates.\n    *   Standard secondaries/dyes used:\n        *   1:2000 DAPI (Concentrations >1:1000 can cause precipitation)\n        *   1:200 Phalloidin 488 (**Caution:** Methanol contamination after this step destroys Phalloidin signal!)\n        *   1:500 Alexa 555 (Donkey Anti-Rabbit)\n        *   1:500 Alexa 680 (Donkey Anti-Mouse)\n12. **Secondary Antibody Incubation (Execution):** Incubate samples in the secondary antibody cocktail for 24 hours at 4°C on a shaker.\n    *   Secondaries can be frozen once but not freeze-thawed repeatedly.\n    *   Large samples may need 2-3 days of incubation.\n\n### Day 4 - Washing & Clearing\n\n13. **Wash 4:** Perform 3 washes with TBST for 15 minutes each at RT.\n    *   To exchange media, use a narrow pipette tip (≤200 µL) kept above the sample, or use a cut tip carefully.\n14. **Wash 5:** Transfer to PBS for 15 minutes to wash off TBST.\n15. **Dehydration/Clearing (Isopropanol):** Titrate through Isopropanol series: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (15 minutes each step).\n    *   This titration significantly contributes to clearing; do not shorten the times.\n    *   Use this time to prepare the imaging chamber.\n16. **Imaging Chamber Preparation:**\n    *   Attach a nylon washer to a coverslip using vacuum grease.\n    *   Press firmly on the washer with tweezers (not a flexible tool) to squeeze out excess grease.\n    *   Seal the perimeter of the washer with nail polish. Wait 15 minutes. Apply a second coat of nail polish.\n    *   After curing, use tweezers to remove any stray grease or polish from the inner diameter of the washer.\n    *   **Pre-use Check:** Add 1:1 Isopropanol:BABB (iso:BABB) to the washer to check for leaks and flush contaminants. Repeat if the liquid turns opaque.\n17. **Clearing (iso:BABB):** Place samples in the final container, add 1:1 iso:BABB. Position the samples if possible. Wait 5 minutes.\n    *   **Caution:** Handle BABB carefully (contains Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Benzoate).\n18. **Clearing (BABB):** Remove iso:BABB with a thin-tip pipette. Add 100% BABB. Position samples if visible.\n19. **Mounting:** Seal the container (e.g., coverslip onto the washer), minimizing air bubbles. Tapping the coverslip helps create a good seal. A small amount of extra BABB can be added during sealing to prevent a large bubble.\n20. **Imaging:** Image as soon as possible after clearing (ideally the same day). DAPI signal fades over time, and bubbles can form in the sample holder.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n*   Can the Triton concentration be lowered? Does it improve the image?\n*   Can TBS be replaced with PBS? What are the effects?\n*   How sensitive is this protocol to CaCl2 concentration, and at which steps is it critical?\n*   Does TCA fixation work better? (Suggested by Raj Ladher for pMLC staining; **Note:** Not compatible with Actin staining).\n*   Does a gradual increase in PFA concentration (e.g., 1% stepped up to 4%) work better? (Suggested by Raj Ladher).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- TO DO: -->\n<!-- include pictures of each step if possible' -->\n<!-- write a section about debugging too much / too little incubation time and antibody amount -->\n<!-- give the writeup of diffusion time. -->\n<!-- (give the pictures of how it works. -->\n\n\n*October 19, 2023*\n\n> **Note:** This protocol is a modification of a protocl given to me by Katie Goodwin, inspired by Crystal Rogers's suggestion to add CaCl2 and use TBS to accommodate ECad staining in the chicken.
